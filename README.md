# Coding assignment "Learn Basic JavaScript Programming" Data Structure Module
## Description 
### There are 3 main.js programs as follows:
#### * Coding Quiz: Object (main.js)
This program consists of three tasks (TODO), each of which indicates a section of code that should be added or improved.
The purpose of this program is to create an object that represents a restaurant with several properties, then retrieve the value of a certain property from the object to be used in testing.
So, this program is an example of JavaScript code that shows how to create an object, access the object's properties, and test the code using console.log().
#### * Coding Quiz: Array (main.js)
This program consists of one task (TODO) that instructs to create an array called evenNumber that contains even numbers from 1 to 100.
The purpose of this program is to create an array containing even numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop and if logic.
So, this program is an example of JavaScript code that generates an array containing even numbers from 1 to 100, and then displays the array using console.log().
#### * Coding Quiz: Map Array (main.js)
This program consists of two tasks (TODO):
TODO 1: Create a map that stores the exchange rate of a currency against several currencies.
TODO 2: Calculate the price in Rupiah (IDR) of the specified price in Japanese Yen (JPY), using the exchange rate stored in the Map.
The purpose of this program is to calculate the price in Rupiah (IDR) based on the price in Japanese Yen (JPY), using the specified exchange rate.
So, this program is a JavaScript script that converts the price from Japanese Yen (JPY) to Rupiah (IDR) using the exchange rate stored in a Map, then displays the price in IDR using console.log().
